This would be provided all parameters except the initial guess, and create an SDC function which only needs the initial values as arguments.\n\nFrom a UX perspective, I like that they will have an SDC function whose only arguments are the initial data. That would be very easy to use. But I don't like that they have to call a function to create a function. That seems like it might be confusing.\n\nActually, I think it would be good to also have Î”t as an argument to the user-SDC function. I can imagine a user might want to use variable timestep size (but they probably don't need to vary the number of collocation nodes, implicit/explicit f, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#SDC.jl","page":"Home","title":"SDC.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Documentation for SDC.jl","category":"page"},{"location":"function-index/","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"Modules = [SDC]","category":"page"},{"location":"types/","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"The following types are exported and available by using SDC.","category":"page"},{"location":"types/","page":"Types","title":"Types","text":"Modules = [SDC]\nOrder = [:type]","category":"page"}]
